# Todo App 🚀

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application built with React. This project allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, deleting, editing, and marking tasks as complete. Tasks are persisted in local storage, ensuring data is retained across sessions. The app also features an animated clock on initial load for a touch of visual appeal.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks to keep them up-to-date.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as complete to track your progress.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the tab or browser.
